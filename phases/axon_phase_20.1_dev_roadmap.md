# Axon Development Roadmap: Phase 19 – CLI Utility Suite, Command Parsing, and Interactive Shell

This document outlines **Phase 19** of the Axon agent system. This phase focuses on building a robust command-line interface (CLI) for environments without a GUI, offering control over core functions, memory inspection, and task management directly from the terminal.

---

## 🔧 19.1 – CLI Command Framework
**Goal:** Establish a foundational CLI using `argparse`, `typer`, or `click`.

**Features:**
- `axon run` – start the full stack (FastAPI + React)
- `axon cli` – run in terminal-only mode
- `axon headless` – run backend API only
- `axon config` – view or edit YAML configuration
- `axon memory` – inspect or query structured/vector memory
- `axon plugin` – list, enable, or disable plugins

---

## ⌨️ 19.2 – Command Parsing and Execution
**Goal:** Interpret and execute structured commands in CLI mode.

**Behaviors:**
- Natural language prompt parsing (e.g., “show me today’s tasks”)
- Support for shorthand commands (e.g., `tasks`, `remind`, `query`)
- Response streaming and history log in terminal

---

## 💬 19.3 – Interactive Shell Mode
**Goal:** Provide a persistent REPL-style environment for power users.

**Features:**
- Type and navigate like a standard shell
- Arrow-key history recall
- Intelligent tab completion (if feasible)
- Load context from memory before responding

**Use Case:**
> Developers, sysadmins, or Raspberry Pi users can interact with Axon even when GUI is unavailable

---

## ✅ Phase 19 Completion Criteria
- CLI entrypoint scaffolded and CLI-only mode operational
- Command parsing supports natural + shorthand formats
- Interactive REPL-style loop running for CLI mode
- Configurable response verbosity and terminal feedback options
