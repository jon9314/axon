# Axon Roadmap: Development Phases for Local-First AI Agent

This roadmap outlines the development path for **Axon**, a modular, local-first AI agent with structured and semantic memory, plugin support, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration.

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 0: Planning & Architecture Finalization (Complete)
- Define goals, LLM access policies, and agent behavior
- Decide on stack: Python, React, FastAPI, Postgres, Qdrant, Ollama
- Finalize config formats: YAML + .env
- Establish memory model: hybrid (PostgreSQL + Qdrant)
- Clarify plugin behavior, startup modes, and CLI/web/headless

---

## üöß Phase 1: Core MVP Scaffold
**Goal:** Local-only chat agent with working memory and UI

- [ ] `main.py`: Bootloader with CLI, web, and headless modes
- [ ] `settings.yaml` and `.env.example` scaffolds
- [ ] `memory_handler.py`: PostgreSQL fact storage
- [ ] `vector_store.py`: Qdrant connection with hybrid retrieval
- [ ] `llm_router.py`: local model selector and fallback handler
- [ ] `mcp_handler.py`: parse/generate MCP messages
- [ ] Sample facts and MCP messages in memory
- [ ] Frontend: React split-pane (chat + memory)
- [ ] Backend: FastAPI API endpoints + WebSocket
- [ ] Docker Compose: Postgres + Qdrant + backend + frontend
- [ ] CI: GitHub Actions with mypy + ruff checks

---

## üß† Phase 2: Memory & Plugin Enrichment
**Goal:** Scoped memory, plugin loader, goal tracking

- [ ] Memory scoping (per thread, per identity)
- [ ] Edit/delete/lock memory entries
- [ ] Plugin system with hot-reload + metadata config
- [ ] Structured long-term goal tracking
- [ ] Manual note tagging + identity recognition
- [ ] Add support for CLI input memory injection

---

## üîå Phase 3: MCP Server Integration
**Goal:** Axon connects to local MCP ecosystem

### Priority MCP Servers
- [ ] **Filesystem**: browse, read, edit files
- [ ] **Time**: get current timestamp for reminders
- [ ] **Calculator**: offload math operations
- [ ] **Basic Memory**: backup or markdown-based memory overlay

### Secondary MCP Targets
- [ ] **GitHub MCP**: repo access and edits
- [ ] **Context7 / DeepWiki / Docs**: documentation fetchers
- [ ] **Text2SQL + Antvis**: structured querying and visualization
- [ ] **WolframAlpha / Prolog / Logic MCPs** (optional advanced logic)

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Phase 4: Remote Model & API Tooling (Optional)
**Goal:** Controlled cloud integration without automatic LLM calls

- [ ] Claude/GPT model suggestion + prompt generation
- [ ] UI support for paste-back workflow
- [ ] Tool/plugin to watch clipboard and auto-insert output
- [ ] Optional fallback through hosted proxy (manual consent only)

---

## üöÄ Phase 5: Personalization & Pro Mode
**Goal:** Multi-user and adaptive interaction support

- [ ] Identity tracking across sessions (you vs. family vs. guest)
- [ ] Model persona shaping based on context (assistant/partner/researcher)
- [ ] Voice adaptation (tone, formality, role-specific)
- [ ] Calendar and scheduling integration
- [ ] Notification system for reminders
- [ ] Mobile UI or TUI wrapper (optional)

## üìå Notes
- Agent name: **Axon** (can be changed later)
- Code-first structure supports low-dependency local execution
- Cloud fallback is entirely manual and user-controlled
- This roadmap will evolve with use-case feedback and plugin growth
