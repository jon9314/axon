# Axon Development Roadmap: Phase 13 – Real Plugin Integration, Safe Runtime Execution, and Dynamic Toolchains

This document outlines **Phase 13** of the Axon agent system. Focus areas include establishing the live plugin system, ensuring runtime safety, and enabling dynamic tool selection based on context.

---

## 🔌 13.1 – Plugin Loader System

**Goal:** Allow Axon to dynamically discover and load plugin modules.

**Design:**

- Plugin folder (e.g., `/plugins`)
- Each plugin has `plugin.yaml` and `main.py`
- `plugin.yaml` includes:

```yaml
name: summarize_pdf
version: 1.0
entry: main.py
permissions:
  - memory_read
  - file_read
```

**Startup Behavior:**

- Scan `/plugins`
- Register available commands in memory
- Log errors but continue running if plugin fails

---

## 🛡 13.2 – Runtime Safety Controls

**Goal:** Prevent accidental or malicious plugin behavior.

**Controls:**

- Command whitelist per plugin
- Memory/API access defined in metadata
- Optional sandbox runner (e.g., subprocess, restricted scope)
- Runtime logs with timestamps and user approval for sensitive actions

---

## 🧠 13.3 – Contextual Toolchain Activation

**Goal:** Enable Axon to choose plugins or tools based on user request and memory context.

**Example:**

> User: “Can you summarize this PDF?”

Axon:

1. Scans plugin registry
2. Finds `summarize_pdf`
3. Checks permission and loads tool
4. Runs dry-run or asks for confirmation before execution

---

## 🧪 13.4 – Plugin Testing Harness

**Goal:** Provide dev-friendly environment to test plugins independently.

**CLI Tool:**

```bash
python test_plugin.py summarize_pdf --file sample.pdf
```

Logs output, errors, and simulated runtime behavior.

---

## ✅ Phase 13 Completion Criteria

- Plugins load dynamically with metadata
- Runtime enforcement of permissions and logging
- Context-based tool matching and activation
- Manual testing CLI for plugins
- At least one working plugin integrated into live agent

Next: Phase 14 – Vector+Structured Memory Sync, Tag-Filtered Retrieval, and Long-Term Summary Rotation
