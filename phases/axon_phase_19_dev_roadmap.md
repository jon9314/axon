# Axon Development Roadmap: Phase 19 – Memory Export, Import, and Cross-Agent Sync Support

This document outlines **Phase 19** of the Axon agent system. Focus areas include data portability, memory archival, and sharing memory state between agents.

---

## 📤 19.1 – Memory Export Options
**Goal:** Allow users to export their structured and vector memory.

**Features:**
- Export PostgreSQL memory as YAML or JSON
- Export vector memory entries from Qdrant with references to structured IDs
- Optional filtering by:
  - Date range
  - Domain/tags (e.g., `project`, `personal`, `cary`)
  - Entry type (`note`, `task`, `fact`, etc.)

**Use Cases:**
- Archiving memory
- Manual transfer to another device or user
- Debugging memory state

---

## 📥 19.2 – Memory Import
**Goal:** Rehydrate memory from exported files, either from same or different agent instance.

**Features:**
- Import structured memory files with validation
- Optional vector re-embedding during import
- Conflict resolution (e.g., skip existing, overwrite, or tag as duplicate)
- Log of imported entries

**Safety Considerations:**
- Lock imported entries unless explicitly editable
- Mark imported entries with origin metadata (`imported_from`, `imported_on`)

---

## 🔄 19.3 – Cross-Agent Sync Mode
**Goal:** Allow optional “handshake” between two Axon agents to exchange memory.

**Features:**
- Export from one → validate and import to another
- Sync scoped by context/project/tag
- Secure token handshake for authenticated sharing (future phase)

**Example Use Case:**
> Agent A on your desktop shares a `roadtrip-planner` context with Agent B running on your laptop.

---

## ✅ Phase 19 Completion Criteria
- Export routines for both structured and vector memory
- Validated import pipeline with tag-preserving behavior
- Conflict handling and logging
- Manual cross-agent sync procedure documented
